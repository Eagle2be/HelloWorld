HelloWorld
==========

I am creating this file for the Data Science course. 

I created it in the github site, yet I could have done it in the command line by the following 
commands: 

touch REAME.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin: https://github.com/Eagle2be/HelloWorld.git


Now becase the file was already created in the gitHub site, I was not able to push the file remotely.
